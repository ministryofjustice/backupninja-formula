## (how to encrypt and optionally sign the backups)
##
## WARNING: old (pre-0.9.4) example.dup used to give wrong information about
##          the way the following options are used. Please read the following
##          carefully.
##
## If the encryptkey variable is set:
##   - data is encrypted with the GnuPG public key specified by the encryptkey
##     variable
##   - if signing is enabled, data is signed with the GnuPG private
##     key specified by the signkey variable
##   - the password variable is used to unlock the GnuPG key(s) used
##     for encryption and (optionnal) signing
##
## If the encryptkey option is not set:
##   - data signing is not possible
##   - the password variable is used to encrypt the data with symmetric
##     encryption: no GnuPG key pair is needed

[gpg]

# when set to yes, encryptkey variable must be set below; if you want to use
# two different keys for encryption and signing, you must also set the signkey
# variable below.
# default is no, for backwards compatibility with backupninja <= 0.5.
sign = $dup_gpg_sign

# ID of the GnuPG public key used for data encryption.
# if not set, symmetric encryption is used, and data signing is not possible.

# A few notes about includes and excludes:
# 1. include, exclude and vsinclude statements support globbing with '*'
# 2. Symlinks are not dereferenced. Moreover, an include line whose path
#    contains, at any level, a symlink to a directory, will only have the
#    symlink backed-up, not the target directory's content. Yes, you have to
#    dereference yourself the symlinks, or to use 'mount --bind' instead.
#    Example: let's say /home is a symlink to /mnt/crypt/home ; the following
#    line will only backup a "/home" symlink ; neither /home/user nor
#    /home/user/Mail will be backed-up :
#      include = /home/user/Mail
#    A workaround is to 'mount --bind /mnt/crypt/home /home' ; another one is to
#    write :
#      include = /mnt/crypt/home/user/Mail
# 3. All the excludes come after all the includes. The order is not otherwise
#    taken into account.
